DeathRoom - Web-Based Game Design Document
Game Overview
DeathRoom is a browser-based 3D game where players navigate through a series of themed rooms, each containing a unique boss. Players must defeat these bosses using movement and combat skills to progress. Each defeated boss unlocks a door to a new room with a stronger boss and better rewards, creating a challenging progression system that rewards players with stat upgrades like increased strength and speed.
Technical Foundation
DeathRoom will be implemented as a web-based game using:

HTML5: For the basic page structure and UI elements
CSS3: For styling UI components and visual effects
JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity
Three.js: As the primary 3D rendering engine
WebGL: For hardware-accelerated 3D graphics

Core Design Elements
1. Room and Environment Design

Themed Rooms: Each room has a unique visual theme (medieval, futuristic, etc.)
Dynamic Lighting: Enhances visual appeal and creates atmosphere
Locked Doors: Initially locked, requiring boss defeat to proceed
Modular Components: Allow for variety while maintaining consistency
Visual Storytelling: Room designs hint at the boss's nature and attacks

2. Boss Design

Unique Characters: Each boss has a distinctive appearance tied to the room's theme
Progressive Difficulty: Bosses become increasingly challenging as players advance
Attack Patterns: Varied attack patterns and behaviors using state machines
Visual Indicators: Clear visual cues for boss attacks and state changes
Themed Abilities: Boss abilities correspond to the room's theme

3. Player Controls and Combat

First-Person Movement: Players navigate rooms from a first-person perspective
Combat Mechanics: Simple but satisfying combat with timing-based attacks
Collision Detection: Prevents players from walking through walls and objects
Visual Feedback: Clear feedback for player actions and damage taken
Dodge Mechanics: Players can dodge boss attacks with proper timing

4. Progression System

Player Statistics: Health, strength, and speed attributes
Stat Upgrades: Each defeated boss provides stat increases
Persistence: Player progress saved between sessions
Visual UI: Clear display of player stats and progression
Scaling Difficulty: Game difficulty increases alongside player power

5. Game Flow

Core Loop: Explore room → Fight boss → Defeat boss → Unlock door → Enter new room
Room Transitions: Smooth transitions between rooms
Game States: Playing, paused, victory, and game over states
Restart Mechanism: Option to restart after defeat
Victory Feedback: Satisfying feedback when a boss is defeated

6. Audio and Visual Effects

Themed Music: Background music matches each room's theme
Sound Effects: Distinctive sounds for attacks, hits, and environmental elements
Particle Effects: Visual effects for attacks and special moves
Ambient Animations: Environmental elements have subtle animations
Screen Effects: Visual indicators for player damage and healing

Making the Game Fun and Graphically Beautiful
Engaging Visuals

PBR Materials: Physically Based Rendering for realistic surfaces
Dynamic Shadows: Enhance depth perception and atmosphere
Particle Systems: For effects like dust, magic, or flames
Smooth Animations: Fluid movements for player and bosses
Post-Processing: Effects like bloom for magical attacks or glowing elements

Engaging Gameplay

Pattern Recognition: Boss patterns require learning and strategy
Balanced Difficulty: Challenging but fair progression
Visual Storytelling: Rooms tell a story through their design
Hidden Secrets: Optional discoveries in each room reward exploration
Combat Feedback: Satisfying visual and audio feedback for successful actions

Technical Considerations
